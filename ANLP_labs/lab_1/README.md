# How to get Lab 1 in Noteable

### If you have already cloned the ANLP Labs folder (i.e., you have Lab 0)

- [Log in to Noteable using this link](https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/login), and start the *Language and Machine Learning* server.
- Once in Notable, go to that ANLP Labs folder that you cloned before.
- From the Noteable menu, click on **Git$\rightarrow$Pull from Remote**.
- You should now see a `lab_1` (or later) subfolder in your labs folder, which will contain both the lab notebook and a solutions notebook.
- Go into the subfolder for the lab you want and open the notebook.

### If you have not yet cloned the ANLP folder

- Follow the instructions for Getting Started on the [main Labs page](https://git.ecdf.ed.ac.uk/anlp/ANLP_labs)
