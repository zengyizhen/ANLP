    "This lab introduces Jupyter notebooks, which we will use for the labs throughout this course. We'll be using Noteable, which is a special version of JupyterLab. If you get stuck or want to learn more about Jupyter/Notebooks/JupyterLab/Notable, you can check out the following links:\n",
    "    \n",
    "- [Noteable User Guide](https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/user-guide/) This guide is the most Noteable-specific, and also includes overview information about notebooks and the JupyterLab interface.\n",
    "- [JupyterLab Documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html) Less Noteable-specific, but even more information!\n",
    "\n",
    "There's also a lot of help within the Notable interface itself! In the Help tab at the top right, you'll find links to lots of reference materials for various tools we'll use in this course.\n",

    "While we aren't teaching Python in this course, we know many of you are new to it. In this lab, we'll also talk about sources you can use to get help with Python and the Python packages we'll use in this course, as well as some debugging techniques for Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The below tutorial is focused on JupyterLab and Noteable, but Jupyter notebooks can be run in many environments. Most things will be the same, but the appearance and the layout of the interface might be a bit different from how it's described here. Further, different editors might have different features: for example, Colab allows real-time collaboration and access to GPUs, but Noteable comes with all the packages you'll need for this course pre-installed and sophisticated debugging features."

    "## 1. What is Jupyter?\n",
    "Jupyter is a platform for interactive computational documents called notebooks. A Jupyter notebook is a file type that allows you to weave together code, text, equations/mathematical notation, visualizations and multimedia. They allow you to run code live alongside formatted explanatory text and see the outputs of the code directly alongside the code. Jupyter notebooks are organized into cells--short snippets which are either text or code. We'll talk more about cells later."

In Command Mode, the currently selected cell will have a <span style=\"color:blue\">blue</span> highlight to the left. In command mode you have access to the following commands, among others:\n",
    "- `<ctrl> + <shift> + h` - Brings up help window (contains full list of shortcuts!)\n",

You can also use Jupyter for other programming languages, like R and Julia. When you run a code cell, the output of the code will display below the cell. To the left of a cell, you will see a number in brackets. This helps you keep track of the order in which code cells were executed. Empty brackets indicate that a cell hasn't been run yet.

You can also make headings, lists, and more. If you're interested, you can learn more markdown here:\n",
