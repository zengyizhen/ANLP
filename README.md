# Labs
#### Accelerated Natural Language Processing (INFR11125)
This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks for the ANLP labs. It also contains instructions for how to get started. We recommend that you use Noteable to do the labs. 

## Accessing Lab 1 and later labs

### If you have already cloned the ANLP Labs folder (you have Lab 0)

- Click the link under Step 1 below to log in to Noteable, and go to your ANLP Labs folder.
- From the Noteable menu, click on **Git$\rightarrow$Pull from Remote**.
- You should now see a `lab_1` (or later) subfolder in your labs folder, which will contain both the lab notebook and a solutions notebook.
- Go into the subfolder for the lab you want and open the notebook.

### If you have not yet cloned the ANLP folder

- Follow the instructions for Getting Started below.

## Gettting Started: Using [Noteable](https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/login)

#### Step 1: 
Go to [https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/login](https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/login). It might ask for your UUN and Password, if you are not logged into Euclid. After login, the following screen will be available with few options to start the server. Or if you have already logged in before it may ask you to reconnect or shutdown the previous server. You can also access it from the Learn course for ANLP

Choose *Language and Machine Learning* from the notebook server dropdown and click *Start* or *Reconnect*.

#### Step 3: 
A small pop-up window will appear, as shown below. Enter the following text for the URI field:  
https://git.ecdf.ed.ac.uk/anlp/ANLP_labs.git   
If you get an error here (bottom right), it may be because you already have a folder with the same name in Noteable.

<!-- #### Step 4: 
In the next pop-up window enter your username (i.e. student number with "s") and the corresponding password. Now click *OK* to copy the labs into Noteable.   
**Be careful copying screenshots of any errors you get from this (e.g. into Piazza) as it may display your password in the error message.**

#### Step 4: 
Once the copying is complete, it will show the repository in a folder titled **ANLP_labs** on the left. Open this folder and you should see its contents. At the start of the course, only Lab 0 will be visible:

#### Step 5: 
Each lab will be a Jupyter notebook in its own folder. Double click the folder for the lab you want to work on, and then double click on the lab's `.ipynb` (Jupyter notebook) file to start working on it.
