    "Jupyter is a platform for interactive computational documents called notebooks. A Jupyter notebook is a file type that allows you to weave together code, text, equations/mathematical notation, visualizations and multimedia. Notebooks allow you to run code and see its outputs, right alongside formatted explanatory text. Jupyter notebooks are organized into *cells*--short snippets which are either text or code.\n",

    "\n",
    "Further, different notebook editors might have different features: for example, Colab allows real-time collaboration and access to GPUs, but Noteable comes with all the packages you'll need for this course pre-installed and sophisticated debugging features (which we will demonstrate in this tutorial!)\n"
